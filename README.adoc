== Presentation and usage

Boardgamemanager is a web application allowing multiple users to manage collaboratively a catalog of board games.

Once logged in, a user can browse existing registered board games, or add new ones to the catalog.

NOTE: This is a dummy application that has only very basic functionalities!
It's purpose is only to be used for teaching purposes.

== Architecture

Boardgamemanager is architectured as two separate components : the _frontend_ − responsible for the graphical user web interface − and the _backend_ − which contains the real business logic, and receives requests coming from the frontend.
Each of these components is an independent piece of software, and they can be deployed separately.

- The *backend* is developed using the Java language (version 17), and relies on a wide range of Java libraries, such as the https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot[Spring Boot framework] or https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson[Jackson].
All the dependencies are managed automatically using https://maven.apache.org/[Maven].
A PostgreSQL database system is required by the backend to store its data.
- The *frontend* is developed using the TypeScript language, and relies also on a wide range of libraries, such as https://angular.io/[Angular].
All the dependencies are managed automatically using https://www.npmjs.com/[npm].
In production, the frontend must be deployed using a regular web server (such as https://www.nginx.com/[nginx]).
This web server must then both provide the frontend, and act as a proxy to forward requests made by the frontend to the backend.
These requests are the ones made on specific endpoints (`/api`, `/management`, `/swagger-resources`, `/v2`, `/auth`).

CAUTION: Since the frontend is purely a graphical web user interface, its code is actually executed in the browser of the user, not on the deployment server.
Then, the frontend (running in the user browser) will send requests to the deployment server in order to reach the backend.
Even though the frontend is not _running_ on the deployment server, do note it must still be _deployed_ on said server using a simple web server.

NOTE: While this figure only shows a single deployment server, it's of course possible to deploy each component (frontend, backend, database) in a different environment.


== Compiling and running the application

=== Running the backend

The backend can be executed in two different modes :

- In *development mode*, the backend does not use a PostgreSQL database system, and instead will use a _fake_ temporary database in memory, which will not be persisted in storage.
This mode is useful for testing purposes.
- In *production mode* the backend runs normally, and requires a PostgreSQL database system to be available and running.

==== In development mode

To *compile and run* the backend in _development mode_ :

- Download the source code.
- Open a terminal and move into the `backend` folder.
- Run Maven with no options:

```
$ mvn
```

This should start the backend server in development mode, which will then await connections from the frontend.
The 'fake' database will contain random values for testing purposes.

==== In production mode

To *compile* the backend in _production mode_ :

- Download the source code.
- Open a terminal and move into the `backend` folder.
- Run Maven with the following option:

```
$ mvn package -Pprod
```

This will produce a single file in the location `target/boardgamemanager-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`.
This file contains the complete backend in an executable format.

Then in order to run the backend in _production mode_, you must first prepare *a configuration file* named `application.yml` with the following contents:
```
spring:
  datasource:
    url: jdbc:postgresql://<database server address>/<database name>
    username: <database user name>
    password: <database user password>
```

where:

- `<database server address>` is the network address of the database server,
- `<database name>` is the name of the database to use within the database server,
- `<database user name>` is the user name to use to connect to the database server,
- `<database user password>` is the password to use to connect to the database server.


Finally, *run the backend in production mode* with the command :

```
$ java -jar target/boardgamemanager-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

NOTE: In your console, you must run this command in the same folder as the one containing the `application.yml` you prepared.

This will start the backend server in production mode, which will connect itself to the database system, then await connections from the frontend.
The database will be initially empty.

=== Running the frontend

Same as the backend, the frontend can be executed in two different modes :

- In *development mode*, a small development web server is executed to distribute the frontend.
In this mode, the frontend will always try to access the backend at the same address as the web server (ie. the frontend and the backend must be run in the very same environment for this mode to work).

- In *production mode*, the frontend must be distributed using a proper production-ready web server (for instance _nginx_).
This mode requires the preparation and configuration of this web server so that it may act as a _proxy_ redirecting requests from the frontend towards the backend.

==== In development mode

To *compile and run* the frontend in _development mode_ :

- Download the source code.
- Open a terminal and move into the `frontend` folder.
- Install the dependencies with this command:
+
```
$ npm install
```
+
This will create a folder `node_modules` containing all downloaded dependencies.
+
- Run the development web server with the command:
```
$ npm run serve
```

This will start a web server listening on port `9000`.
Accessing this web server with a browser will download and run the frontend in the browser.

CAUTION: As already explained, running the web server in this mode will provide the frontend but will _not_ act as a proxy to redirect requests made to the backend.
Therefore this mode is not compatible with running the frontend and the backend in different environments.



==== In production mode

Production mode first requires to compile the frontend into a form that can then be distributed using a production web server.
In this guide we use _nginx_, but other web servers (such as Apache) can work perfectly fine as well.

To *compile* the frontend in _production mode_ :

- Download the source code.
- Open a terminal and move into the `frontend` folder.
- Install the dependencies with this command:
+
```
$ npm install
```
- Then run the following command:
+
```
$ npm run build
```
+
This will produce a new folder at the location `target/classes/static/`. 
This folder contains the complete compiled frontend ready to be deployed within a web server.


Now a web server must be prepared with the correct configuration to act as a _proxy_ when receiving specific requests from the frontend.
When acting as a proxy, the web server will forward these specific requests to the backend.

The requests that must be forwarded are the ones targeting:

- `/api`,
- `/management`,
- `/swagger-resources`,
- `/v2`,
- `/auth`.

In this documentation we use _nginx_ as a web server to fulfill this task.

First, prepare an nginx configuration file called `default.conf` with the following contents :

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    index index.html;
    server_name localhost;
    error_log  /var/log/nginx/error.log;

    root /usr/share/nginx/html;

    location /api {
        proxy_pass http://<backend address>/api;
    }
    location /management {
        proxy_pass http://<backend address>/management;
    }
    location /swagger-resources {
        proxy_pass http://<backend address>/swagger-resources;
    }        
    location /v2 {
       proxy_pass http://<backend address>/v2;
    }
    location /auth {
       proxy_pass http://<backend address>/auth;
    }
 
    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
    }
}
```

where `<backend address>` is the network address that the web server should use to reach the backend.

Then, start an nginx server with:

- The content of `target/classes/static/` as the starting point of the website it serves.
By default, nginx will search this content in `/usr/share/nginx/html`.
- The file `default.conf` you prepared as the default configuration for the nginx instance.
By default, nginx will search this file in `/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf`.

You can now use a browser to connect to you nginx server, which will provide you with the frontend.
Then, when the frontend will make a request to the backend (for instance a `/api` request), they will be forwarded to the backend thanks to the configuration you prepared.
